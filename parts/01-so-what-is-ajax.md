## So what is AJAX?

Essentially, it's a technique that allows web developers
to fetch data from a server asynchronously â€“ that is,
without requiring that the user make new HTTP(S) requests
via the browser.

To make this possible, AJAX (commonly) leverages the
following core technologies:

- HTML and CSS
- the Document Object Model (aka the DOM)
- XMLHttpRequest object or, more recently, (also) the
  Fetch API
- JSON (or XML)
- JavaScript
