## A brief history of the web and web accessibility

### The 90s 'Browser Wars'

- 1996: 80% of web users were using Netscape Navigator

- Microsoft felt threatened by the web and introduced
  Internet Explorer to compete with Netscape

- Netscape and Microsoft raced to introduce new features,
  like:

  - JavaScript (by Netscape in 1995, at first called
    'Mocha')
  - XMLHttpRequest (by Microsoft in 1998)
  - (both of these are technologies leveraged by the AJAX
    technique)

- Microsoft too big for Netscape to fight alone, so
  Netscape teamed-up with Sun Microsystems

  - 'Mocha' becomes 'JavaScript' to tap into the hype
    around Java

- Sun and Netscape pushed for the standardization of
  JavaScript to prevent Microsoft from getting control
  over the future of the language

- By the start of the 2000s, around 90% of web users were
  browsing on Internet Explorer

- Microsoft dealt with lawsuits around their monopolistic
  practices
