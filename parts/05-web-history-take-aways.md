## A brief history of the web and web accessibility

### Take-aways

- A wide variety of people will be using our web apps, in
  a variety of different contexts, and it's therefore
  important to make our apps as accessible as possible

- New tech doesn't become popular (just) because it's
  'better,' but as a result of complex human practices and
  negotiations â€“ like corporate interests, laws and
  regulations, or activism

  - The more aware of this we are, the likelier we are to
    influence the direction of technical developments, the
    likelier we are to change the parts of JS that annoy
    us ;)
